## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the library manager issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes library manager commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

Here's the partial class diagram showing the interaction between the abstract Command class and the various command classes.

<puml src="diagrams/CommandClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* stores a `Library` object that represents the library data i.e. `Threshold` and all `Book` objects. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyLibrary` object. The books are exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Book>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Merit Score feature

**Merit Score Attribute:**
* Added to the `Person` class.
* Represents a measurement of a library user's credibility.
* Default merit score of 0 assigned to every library user upon instantiate to the Contact List.

**Operations Affecting Merit Score:**
* Donating books: Increases the library user's merit score by 1.
* Returning books: Increases the library user's merit score by 1.
* Borrowing books: Decreases the library user's merit score by 1.

**Threshold Check Before Borrowing:**
* Implemented in `MyBookshelf`.
* Ensures that a library user's merit score exceeds the limit threshold before allowing a successful borrow.
* Library users must have a merit score greater than or equal to the threshold to borrow books successfully.

**Threshold Setting:**
* Library users can set the threshold using the `limit` command.
* Allows customization of the threshold limit, which determines the minimum merit score required for successful borrowing.

These changes aim to regulate borrowing behavior, preventing excessive borrowing and ensuring fair access to library resources based on library user's credibility as measured by their merit score.

### Library and LibraryStorage feature

**Library Class:**
* This class represents all available books in a library.
* It contains methods for adding, deleting, and listing books, as well as checking if a person can borrow a book based on their merit score.
* It internally uses an ObservableList<Book> to manage the list of books.
* It also manages a Threshold object to determine if a person can borrow a book.
* Notably, it does not directly handle storage operations such as loading or saving books from/to a file. Instead, it delegates these responsibilities to the LibraryStorage class.

**LibraryStorage Class:**
* This class manages the loading and saving of available books to a text file.
* It uses a file path to determine where to store the data.
* It handles loading threshold and book data from a file into an ObservableList<Book> and Threshold object respectively.
* It also saves threshold and book data from an ReadOnlyLibrary object (which is implemented by the Library class) to a file.

These two classes work together to provide functionality for managing a library's collection of books, with `Library` handling operations directly related to book management and `LibraryStorage` handling file I/O operations.

This separation of concerns helps in keeping the code modular and maintainable.

`Library` now acts as a similar entity to the `AddressBook` and `UserPrefs` and is now composited into `Model`, and implements the ReadOnlyLibrary Interface.

`Model` now contains useful `Library` operations such as:
* `Threshold` operations
* `Book` operations on the book list in a library
* Checks for if library users can borrow books in a library

[Link to updated Model UML Class diagram]

### Limit Command and Threshold feature

This command is facilitated through the use of `Threshold` as an attribute in the `Library` class.

Any library user has to have a `Merit Score` greater or equals to the set `Threshold` in order to borrow from the `Library`.

As `Threshold` is now an attribute of `Library`, the library user's ability to borrow now depends on the Library instance and not within the Borrow Command.

Limit Command sets the `Threshold` of the `Library`, resulting in all library users being affected by the change at the same time when the Limit Command is called.

The default value of a `Threshold` is set as `-3`. Any calls to the Limit Command with the same value of the current `Threshold` will result in a duplicate threshold detected message.

`Library` now has a method to check if a library user can borrow a book from the library by internally comparing the user's `Merit Score` and the library's `Threshold`. Borrow Command now utilises this function to check if a user is able to Borrow a book from the Library instead of handling the check within the Borrow Command itself.

#### Desired Usage

Library managers can retroactively disallow library users from borrowing books from the Library, with library users having to meet the limit set before being able to borrow again.

1. Library starts in a default state. After some borrowing occurred.
   * Library user A has `Merit Score`:0
   * Library user B has `Merit Score`: -2
   * Both library user A and library user B can borrow books from the library
1. Library manager calls `limit 0`
   * `Threshold`: 0
   * Library user A has `Merit Score`: 0 (greater than or equal to `Threshold`)
   * Library user B has `Merit Score`: -2 (less than `Threshold`)
   * Library user A can borrow but library user B cannot borrow from the Library
1. Library manager calls `limit -2`
   * `Threshold`: -2
   * Library user A has `Merit Score`: 0 (greater than or equal to `Threshold`)
   * Library user B has `Merit Score`: -2 (greater than or equal to `Threshold`)
   * Both library user A and library user B can borrow books from the library
1. Library user B borrows a book
   * `Threshold`: -2
   * Library user A has `Merit Score`: 0 (greater than or equal to `Threshold`)
   * Library user B has `Merit Score`: -3 (greater than or equal to `Threshold`)
   * Library user A can borrow but library user B cannot borrow from the Library
1. Library manager calls `limit 1`
   * `Threshold`: 1
   * Library user A has `Merit Score`: 0 (less than `Threshold`)
   * Library user B has `Merit Score`: -3 (less than `Threshold`)
   * Both library user A and library user B cannot borrow books from the library
1. Library user A returns a book and library user B donates a book each
   * `Threshold`: 1
   * Library user A has `Merit Score`: 1 (greater than or equal to `Threshold`)
   * Library user B has `Merit Score`: -2 (less than `Threshold`)
   * Both library user A and library user B can donate and return to the library
   * Library user A can borrow but library user B still cannot borrow from the Library

#### Alternative Implementation

It is also plausible for `Threshold` to be implemented as an attribute within each library user.

This would also change the implementation for the `limit` Command to now individually set limits to each specified library user.

This would give the library manager greater flexibility to vary each of the library user's individual ability to borrow books.

This implementation was decided against as setting a standardised limit would give an easier time for library managers to manage all library users at the same time, and not having to individually manage each user's `Threshold`

Individual library user's ability to borrow can also be increased and decreased indirectly by changing the library user's merit score. **[LINK TO SECTION ON CHANGING MERIT SCORE]**

Note: the library user's Merit Score cannot be decreased without altering the library user's borrowing book list. **[LINK TO SECTION ON DECREASING MERIT SCORE]**

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The library manager launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The library manager executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The library manager executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The library manager now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the library manager rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the library manager rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The library manager then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The library manager executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a library manager executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Future Enhancements**

1. More specific constraints for the `EMAIL` parameter.
   * Add checks for top-level domain (.com, .net, .co etc) into regular expression
1. Handling of extreme values to be added.
   * Add checks for `INDEX` and `THRESHOLD` to be parsed within the boundaries of Java's Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE.
   * Add a limit on the String length for `NAME`, `PHONE-NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, `ADDRESS`, `TAG`, `KEYWORD`, `BOOKTITLE` to a reasonable length.
1. Improve clarity of command results.
   * Reduce information related to Person displayed when command successfully executes to reduce bloat. Can be done by:
     * Editing toString() to display less information.
     * Reformatting toString() to include new lines for easier readability.
     * Format specific fields to be displayed into the command result.
   * Change message when `clear` command is executed to use the words "Contact List" instead of "Address book" for clarity.
   * Improve error message when `INDEX` entered by library manager is greater than the length of the Contact List to be clearer (e.g. Index is larger than the number of people in the list).
   * Improve the usage message for commands that changes like `borrow`, `return`, `edit`.
     * Change the phrasing of "Edits the book list" to be clearer (E.g. "Remove book from library user's book list" in `return` command).
     * Remove the phrase "in the last person listing" as it is confusing.
1. Change the definition of a duplicate Person.
   * Currently only checks if the `NAME` field are exactly the same.
   * Can be changed to check if `PHONE` or `EMAIL` are exactly the same as they are unique identifiers and not `NAME`.
   * Allows for `NAME` to be case-insensitive (John Doe and john doe are the same person).
   * Allows for library users with the same name to exist (John Doe with phone number 123 is different from John Doe with phone number 911).
   * Can throw warnings if `NAME` differs by only by whitespaces (John Doe and John   Doe are similar and could be duplicates).
1. Add labels under each library user in the Contact List panel in the UI
   * Label each field to allow for easier readability, especially between email and address (e.g. e: example@email.com, a: Kent Ridge View).

2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A library manager with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Should be easy to use and fast to learn for library managers who are new to this application.
5. Response time should be fast enough that it does not take the library manager a long time to use it.
6. Should be easy to recognise and remember necessary commands to minimise need for library manager to check what command to use.

*{More to be added}*

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS.
* **Library Manager**: Community Library Managers (CLM) are the people using the MyBookshelf application. CLMs are responsible for adding, storing, and updating the entire library database via *MyBookshelf*.
* **Library User**: The people that are saved into the Contact List of *MyBookshelf*. Sometimes referred as to "borrowers".
* **Personal Information**: Personal Information of a library user, e.g. name, phone number, email, address and tags, but not borrowed books and merit score.
* **Book**: Identified by its `BOOKTITLE`. Appears in both the `Library User`'s book list and the `Library Book List`.
* **Borrow**: An action where a library user borrows a book from the library.
* **Return**: An Action where a library user returns the book which they borrowed from the library.
* **Donate**: An action where a person donates a book to the library.
* **Merit Score**: A score associated with each `Library User`. This score provides an estimate of the number of books a library user can borrow.
* **Threshold**: A threshold for merit score. A library user must higher merit score than threshold in order to borrow books. Threshold can be set to the library by library manager anytime.
* **Contact List**: Refers to the list of library users currently stored in the *MyBookshelf* application. It appears in the left column of the User Interface.
* **Library Book List**: Refers to the list of available `Book`(s) currently stored in the *MyBookshelf* application. It appears in the right column of the User Interface. Sometimes referred as "library" or "available books".
